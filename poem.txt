My uncle was a man of virture,
When he became quite old and sick,
He sought respect and tried to teach me,
His only heir, verte and weak.
He had the fun, I had the sore,
But grecious goodness! what a bore!
To sit by bedplace day and night,
Not doing even step aside,
And what a cheep and cunning thing
To entertain the sad,
To serve around, make his bed,
To fetch the pills, to mourn and grim,
To sigh outloud, think along:
`God damn old man, why ain't you gone?'
So thought a playboy, young and funny,
While riding through the dust of road,
The only heir to the money,
That got his folks with help of Lord.
My reader! if introduce I may
Without comments, right away,
Onegin, my old friend
Was born , you know, in the Niva land.
And you may have been born in there,
The place of style, the vanity fair,
Where I had spent a lot of time,
But moved - the climate wasn't fine.
